# PyGitUpdater
PyGitUpdater is a Python-based tool designed to seamlessly update independent projects via Git

PyGitUpdater is a Python-based tool that allows you to check for updates to your application and download them if available. It was originally created for my fork of the GreenLuma Manager, but it can be used as a standalone tool for any independent project hosted on GitHub.

How to Use
Create a local JSON file that contains the current version of your project.
Provide the GitHub URL where the remote version of your application can be found.
(Optional) Specify a prefix to remove from the remote version.
(Optional) Specify a path where the update will be downloaded. If not provided, the update will be downloaded in the current directory.

### Unpacker Class Documentation

#### Overview
The `Unpacker` class in Python is designed to handle the extraction and renaming of files from a zip archive. It is particularly useful for applications that need to process downloaded zip files, such as an updater system.

#### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, download_path, prefix='', untouch=[]):
```
The constructor of the `Unpacker` class initializes the instance with the following parameters:
- `download_path`: The path where the downloaded files are located and where the extracted files will be moved.
- `prefix`: An optional string that will be prefixed to the names of the extracted files.
- `untouch`: An optional list of filenames that should not be renamed during the extraction process.

#### Methods
##### extract_and_rename
```python
def extract_and_rename(self, file_path):
```
The `extract_and_rename` method is responsible for extracting files from a zip archive and renaming them according to the specified prefix, while leaving the files listed in `untouch` unchanged.

**Steps performed by `extract_and_rename`:**
1. Create a temporary directory within the `download_path` to hold the extracted files.
2. Open the zip file and extract its contents to the temporary directory.
3. Delete the original zip file after extraction.
4. Move and rename the extracted files to the `download_path`, applying the prefix if necessary.
5. Remove any files that already exist with the same name in the destination.
6. Recursively remove empty directories left in the temporary directory.
7. Delete the temporary directory and all its contents.

#### Usage Example
To use the `Unpacker` class, you would first create an instance by providing the required `download_path` and optionally the `prefix` and `untouch` list. Then, call the `extract_and_rename` method with the path to the zip file you wish to process.

```python
unpacker = Unpacker('/path/to/downloads', prefix='new_', untouch=['keepme.txt'])
unpacker.extract_and_rename('/path/to/downloaded.zip')
```

This will extract the contents of `downloaded.zip`, rename the files (excluding 'keepme.txt'), and move them to '/path/to/downloads'.

#### Notes
- The class uses the `os`, `shutil`, and `zipfile` modules, which are part of the Python Standard Library.
- It includes error handling for file operations, such as checking if a file exists before attempting to delete it.
- The class provides print statements for debugging purposes, which can be removed or replaced with logging as needed.

### RemoteVersionChecker Class Documentation

#### Overview
The `RemoteVersionChecker` class is designed to interact with a remote repository, such as GitHub, to check for the latest version of a software or project. It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and the `json` library to parse the response.

#### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, github_url, prefix=None):
```
The constructor initializes the `RemoteVersionChecker` instance with the following parameters:
- `github_url`: The URL of the GitHub API endpoint that provides the latest release information.
- `prefix`: An optional string that represents a prefix in the tag name that should be stripped when retrieving the version number.

#### Methods
##### get_version
```python
def get_version(self):
```
The `get_version` method fetches the latest version of the software from the GitHub API and returns it as a string. If a `prefix` is provided, it will be removed from the tag name to get the clean version number.

#### Usage Example
To use the `RemoteVersionChecker` class, create an instance by providing the GitHub API URL and optionally a prefix. Then, call the `get_version` method to retrieve the latest version.

```python
checker = RemoteVersionChecker('https://api.github.com/repos/username/project/releases/latest', prefix='v')
latest_version = checker.get_version()
print(latest_version)
```

This will print the latest version number of the project, excluding the 'v' prefix if it's present in the tag name.

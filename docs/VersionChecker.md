### VersionReader Class Documentation

#### Overview
The `VersionReader` class is responsible for reading the local version of the software from a JSON configuration file. It uses the `json` and `os` libraries to read and parse the JSON file.

#### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, json_file_path):
```
The constructor initializes the `VersionReader` instance with the following parameter:
- `json_file_path`: The path to the JSON file that contains the version information. It supports replacing `%userprofile%` with the actual username from the environment variable.

#### Methods
##### get_version
```python
def get_version(self):
```
The `get_version` method reads the JSON file specified in the `json_file_path` and returns the version number of the software as a string.

#### Usage Example
To use the `VersionReader` class, create an instance by providing the path to the JSON configuration file. Then, call the `get_version` method to retrieve the local version.

```python
reader = VersionReader('C:\\Users\\%userprofile%\\config.json')
local_version = reader.get_version()
print(local_version)
```

This will print the local version number of the software as specified in the `config.json` file.

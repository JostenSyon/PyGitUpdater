### Downloader Class Documentation

#### Overview
The `Downloader` class is a Python utility designed to download files from the internet, specifically tailored for downloading release assets from a URL, which can be a direct link or an API endpoint that provides release information in JSON format.

#### Constructor
```python
def __init__(self, url_release, direct_download=False, download_path=None):
```
The constructor initializes the `Downloader` instance with the following parameters:
- `url_release`: The URL from which the file or release information will be downloaded.
- `direct_download`: A boolean flag indicating whether to download the file directly without user confirmation.
- `download_path`: The path where the downloaded file will be saved. If not specified, the current working directory is used.

#### Methods
##### download_file
```python
def download_file(self):
```
The `download_file` method performs the following actions:
1. Sends an HTTP GET request to the `url_release`.
2. Checks the HTTP status code of the response to ensure the request was successful.
3. Parses the JSON response to extract the download URL and file size information.
4. Prompts the user for confirmation to download the file unless `direct_download` is set to `True`.
5. Downloads the file and saves it to the specified `download_path`.
6. Returns the full path to the downloaded file.

#### Usage Example
To use the `Downloader` class, create an instance by providing the release URL, and optionally set `direct_download` and `download_path`. Then, call the `download_file` method to start the download process.

```python
downloader = Downloader('https://api.github.com/repos/username/project/releases/latest')
downloaded_file_path = downloader.download_file()
print(f"Downloaded file path: {downloaded_file_path}")
```

This will download the latest release asset from the specified GitHub repository and print the path to the downloaded file.

#### Notes
- The class uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests, which must be installed separately as it is not part of the Python Standard Library.
- It includes error handling for HTTP requests and file operations.
- The class provides print statements for user interaction and feedback, which can be replaced with a logging system or a GUI prompt as needed.
